# Filepass - Revisions Completed
Filepass is a great tool for handling client revisions. The only problem is that there is no way for the client to tell you they've finished adding revision requests without emailing or messaging you. 

This Wordpress plugin works in tandem with a custom link added to the revisions board in Filepass. When the client clicks that link, they're taken to a page on Wordpress that displays a custom message and project information taken from the query string is passed via webhook to Make or another service to be processed.
